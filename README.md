# Rainfall Prediction with Machine Learning

# Overview:
This project aims to predict whether rainfall will occur tomorrow using machine learning techniques. The analysis utilizes a dataset sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

# Features:
<b>Australian Dataset:</b> The project is based on an Australian dataset containing historical weather data, crucial for training the machine learning models.
<br><b>Notebook Execution:</b> To run the project, download and execute the provided notebook on your local machine. Ensure that the dataset is also available locally for seamless execution.
<br><b>User Interface:</b> The project incorporates a user interface implemented in Python, facilitating user interaction for predicting rainfall for a specified date.

# Instructions:
<b>Clone the Repository</b>: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract its contents.
<br><b>Install Dependencies:</b> Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
<br>pip install -r requirements.txt
<br><b>Run the Notebook:</b> Open the provided Jupyter notebook (rainfall_prediction.ipynb) in your preferred environment and execute each cell sequentially.
<br><b>Input Required Date:</b> Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to input the desired date for rainfall prediction.
<br><b>View Prediction:</b> Upon execution, the notebook will display the predicted rainfall status for the specified date.

# Note:
This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the application of machine learning in rainfall prediction.
The user interface provides a convenient way to interact with the predictive model, enabling users to forecast rainfall for their desired dates.
